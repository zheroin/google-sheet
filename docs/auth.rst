Signed Credentials

email. No Authentication will be required in this case.

This is how this file may look like:

::

    {
        "type": "service_account",
        "project_id": "p....sdf",
        "private_key_id": "48.....",
        "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nNrDyLw â€¦ jINQh/9\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "client_email": "p.....@appspot.gserviceaccount.com",
        "client_id": "10.....454",
    }



6. Find the client_id from the file, your application will be able to acess any sheet which is shared with this email. To use this file initiliaze the pygsheets client as shown
::

    gc = pygsheets.authorize(service_file='service_creds.json')


OAuth Credentials
-----------------
This is the best option if you are trying to edit the spreadsheet on behalf of others. Here for the first time the user will
be asked to authenticate your application. From therafter the application can acess all his spreadsheets. For using this
you will need 'OAuth client ID' file. Follow this procedure below to generate it -
